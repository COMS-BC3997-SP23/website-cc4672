<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This academic paper investigates the impact of technology on the finance industry, including its potential to displace human workers in areas such as customer service and trading. The paper begins by examining the history of technological adoption in finance, highlighting the major milestones and breakthroughs that have transformed the industry over time. The paper then transitions to focus on current tools being utilized in finance and explores the positive impacts and potential drawbacks of increasing technologization in finance. Additionally, the paper examines the differences between traditional financial tools and newer technologies, assesses how current college curriculums may be falling short in preparing students for the workforce, and explores how companies leverage technology to streamline financial processes and services. Finally, the paper proposes potential future trends and technological developments that will likely shape the finance industry in the coming years based on research and experimentation. By exploring these various aspects, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how technology has been utilized in finance and its potential to transform the industry.</p>

  <summary>Weeks 1-2 </summary>
The first portion of at least two weeks was thinking and writing the preliminary research proposal. Then, the issue became that I got COVID, causing a bit of a delay with the work. Below is a bit thought process of my initial reasonings: 

As my undergraduate life draws closer, I reflect on what I have gained. It saddens me to realize that I haven't accomplished as much as I could have, not only in terms of computer science projects and GPA but also in general. However, I am certain that some of my professors, peers, and friends would disagree with this pessimistic view. With this research project, I aim to satisfy my curiosity and bring closure to my somewhat tumultuous undergraduate life in a way that would make me proud, even if no one else takes pride in my work. Rather than presenting it in the typical report format or opting for the "successful" approach, I wish to pursue this project in a manner that speaks to me and showcases my unique abilities.

Throughout my years of education, I have always been passionate about learning practical and applicable knowledge. I have come to realize that being able to observe the concrete changes and impacts that my efforts are creating is what motivates me to thrive and learn. One field that has always intrigued me is how technology is utilized in various sectors, not just within the tech industry. Specifically, I have been interested in exploring how algorithmic trading and the stock market function with the aid of technology. Observing how these trading strategies operate and their effectiveness in the real world is fascinating.
